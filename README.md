#### Abstract:
<p align=" justify"> According to sensorimotor accounts of perceptual experience, subjective presence/veridicality of objects builds up gradually as one learns how changes in sensory inputs depend on bodily movements. To investigate how sensorimotor interactions shape visual experience, we designed a virtual reality-based setup allowing us to manipulate the complexity of visuomotor spatial dependencies governing interactions with unfamiliar 3D objects. Across two goal-oriented tasks, participants had to learn to manually control fully visible objects to reach or follow visually cued rotations. In different conditions, virtual objects moved in congruent, opposite, novel (orthogonal), or random directions in response to manual movements. This procedure allowed the assessment of sensorimotor performance and enabled us to associate distinct objects with different coupling rules. The two sensorimotor control tasks occurred alternately with the continuous flash suppression (CFS) task, during which stationary objects underwent perceptual suppression. We hypothesised that virtual objects whose motion was experienced as depending on actions in a lawful, and thus encodable, manner (i.e., according to a congruent, opposite, or novel – but not random – dependency) would be detected faster than objects moving randomly in response to actions (for which there is no world-related statistical structure to learn). We first found that performance in the sensorimotor tasks consistently decreased along with the difficulty of the conditions (i.e., congruent > opposite > novel > random). However, the pre-registered analysis yielded no significant differences in CFS breakthrough times of objects manipulated under different coupling rules. An exploratory analysis assessing whether the acquisition of 'sensorimotor mastery' was associated with reduced detection times also showed no significant effects. 
Our finding of no difference in the perception of stimuli moving in line with and opposite to lifelong expectations concurs with previous results in this field. We expected this based on the assumption that both congruent and opposite dependencies may be relatively easy to learn. Indeed, the sensorimotor tasks indicated good performance in both these conditions, contrasting with the low performance in the other conditions. Nevertheless, our hypothesis of slower conscious access to randomly responding objects was not confirmed, suggesting the ineffectiveness of sensorimotor spatial manipulations in interocular suppression paradigms. Notably, in all conditions, object movement remained tightly coupled (i.e., contingent) to the participant's actions, and such stimuli have already been shown to break suppression faster than uncoupled/prerecorded visual inputs (Suzuki et al., 2019). Thus, one possible explanation of our results is that mere sensorimotor contingency may be a sufficiently salient factor to override any influences related to the identifiability of specific spatial dependencies.

#### Steps to reproduce the analysis:
- download the entire repository as a zip-file 
- open the relevant code files in the downloaded folder (by clicking, i.e. not directly from R studio, as the “here” function is used for setting the directory)
- make sure that you have all the required packages installed (they are loaded in the first chunk of each code file)
- for each code file, run the analysis chunk by chunk in sequential order.

The folder “_data” will contain both raw data files for each subject and the preprocessed data frames. The relevant data frames will be automatically read while running individual code files.

The folder “_figures” will contain the main and supplementary plots.

R Markdown reports (HTML files) present all the code files used along with their outputs.
